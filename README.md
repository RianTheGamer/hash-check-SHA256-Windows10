# hash-check-SHA256-Windows10
Windows 10 hash checking between two directories
ONLY FOR WINDOWS 10!

This program will check hashes directories between two directories (or folders), NOT FILE.
Input the location of first directory and second directory of your desire, then it will do everything for you.

Note:
1. Works on Windows 10.
2. Tested on only small files, as big files will be longer to wait.
3. Again, this is for folders, not files.
4. Wrote this program just for my own use. If it sucks, then it sucks.
